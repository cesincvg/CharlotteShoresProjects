CS216 Lab12 - C++ Program with Template Class and Operator Overloading

This repository contains the source code for Lab12 of CS216 (Introduction to Software Engineering Techniques) course.
The project involves modifying the SortingList class into a template class, completing the definition of the Card class 
with operator overloading, and implementing the main function for sorting operations. It emphasizes generic programming
using templates and user input validation. The program showcases sorting operations on various data items, demonstrating 
proficiency in C++ concepts.
