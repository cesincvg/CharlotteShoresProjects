Specifically, we used Bootstrap to create the front end of a website. We will not be connecting the 
front end to any backend so any information included on the page was hard coded. We were tasked with 
creating a basic three-page website using HTML, CSS (or SASS), JavaScript, and Bootstrap. This was later turned into a react app.
