The purpose of this application is to serve as a foundation for implementing card-based games that utilize 52-card decks. In the initial stage, the program displays the cards arranged in a specific layout: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades, with each suit organized in ascending order from Ace to King. The Shuffle, Reset, and Quit buttons allow users to shuffle the cards, reset the layout to the initial position, and exit the application, respectively.
