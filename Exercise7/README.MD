In this assignment, I wrote an IntelliJ Java project that runs a Bspline-based visual simulation called Hoops. I was able to
provide visual display and control of the simulation via a graphical user interface.


The program runs a simulation of control points that bounce around the screen as in the provided
example code simulation “BouncingBall.java” and “Ball.java”. I was able to define four such control
points, which taken together will define four Bspline curve sections that, when rendered together form a
closed smooth Bspine circuit. The four control points define how to draw a Bspline “hoop” at
every instantaneous position, rendered over time to create the illusion of a moving, animated, distorting
hoop. The simulation will appears geometrically interesting as the control points independently bounce
around the screen.
