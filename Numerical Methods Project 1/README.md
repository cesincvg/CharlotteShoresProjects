This project aims to provide a comprehensive set of MATLAB functions for solving Kepler's equation and determining the 
position of satellites in their orbits. Orbital mechanics play a crucial role in space exploration, satellite communications,
and astronomy. By accurately calculating satellite positions, astronomers and engineers can plan and monitor space missions with 
precision.

This toolbox includes MATLAB functions for root finding using the bisection method and Newton's method, as well as a 
combined approach integrating both methods. Additionally, it provides a function for solving Kepler's equation and 
computing the position of satellites in their orbital planes. The project is accompanied by a detailed PDF report
explaining the mathematical models, implementation details, and validation tests.
