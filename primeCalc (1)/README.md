Welcome to the Prime Calculator GUI project! This Java application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for determining whether a given positive integer is prime. Leveraging the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, the GUI allows users to input or select any number between 2 and 1,000,000 and quickly identifies whether the number is prime or not.

The sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm efficiently generates all prime numbers up to a specified limit by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime starting from 2. This algorithm is used behind the scenes to calculate prime numbers, providing users with fast and accurate results.

The user-friendly interface enables users to input or select a number via GUI elements, such as text fields or dropdown menus. Upon submitting the number, the GUI dynamically displays whether the selected number is prime or composite, providing instant feedback to the user.
