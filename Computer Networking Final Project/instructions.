Hi! Welcome to our happy little client/server network :)
Here are some instructions that will help you navigate the file transfer:

- First, go into the Client 1 code (this is denoted by BrandtClient.py) and change the contents of the 
  variable name "filename" according to the instructions in the file. Also change the IP address found in both Client 1 and CLient 2's 
  code to that of whatever machine you are using to run the server code.
    - This is where you are able to adjust which file Client 1 is asking for.
- Start up the server. This can be found in the server.py file.
- Next run the Client 1 code 
    - On the client side, this should alert you of a successful connection with the server, 
      let you know that the client is waiting, and that the reciept of the file has been initiated. 
      The terminal should pause here if the server is not in possession of the file already.
    - On the server side, it should also alert you of a connection, as well as the name of the file requested by the client
        - if the server is in possession of the file, it will send it immediately to the client. If not, it will stall here.
- If the terminals pause, this is the queue to run the Client 2 code (found in the file jdClient.py) which will send the
  requested file over to the server, who will send it to the other client, who will write it into a file called recieved_file
- Finally the server will delete the file it sent to Client 1 if it was not already in possession of it
